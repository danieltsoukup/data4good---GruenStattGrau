# data4good---GruenStadtGrau
In this repository, you'll find some of our NLP work (with explanation) from the <a href = "https://trendydots.com/data4good/" >data4good hackathon</a>. 

We worked on analysing various text for GreunStadtGrau, a non-profit company working on urban greening projects. Our teams contributions involved converting and cleaning raw, unstructured pdf files (magazines) into data that we can actually analyse; we ran LDA algorithms for topic modelling; using Spacy's NER, we extracted relevant locations and organisations in the urban greening business; we visualized our findings on interactive maps and highlighted co-occuring entities on graphs (geotext and networkx); we put forward a simple optimisation model for creating green corridors in urban areas; we created a content marking tool to isolate legal terms.

You can find a short description of our work <a href = "https://trendydots.com/data4good/challenge1.html" >here</a> at the project website and in our final <a href = "/assets/ch1-final-results.pdf" >presentation</a>.
